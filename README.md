# Economic-Cycle

In the following study:

“Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor. 2017. “Macrofinancial History and the New Business Cycle Facts.” in NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2016, volume 31, edited by Martin Eichenbaum and Jonathan A. Parker. Chicago: University of Chicago Press."

the researchers aim to provide convenient no-cost open access under a license to the most extensive long-run macro-financial dataset to date. The database covers 17 advanced economies since 1870 on an annual basis. It comprises 25 real and nominal variables such as bank credit to the non-financial private sector, mortgage lending and long-term house prices. The database captures the near-universe of advanced-country macroeconomic and asset price dynamics, covering on average over 90 percent of advanced-economy output and over 50 percent of world output.

In this project we will use machine learning algorithm to predict the economic cycle, natural fluctuation of the economy between periods of expansion (growth) and contraction (recession).
